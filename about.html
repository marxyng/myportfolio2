    <img src ="pexels-photo.jpg" alt="laptop with notebook" class="firstPic">

    <p>A little about me, I went to Alabama State University before transferring to University of Alabama at Birmingham.  I finished with a B.A. in History 
      <br/>
      and minor in Political Science.  During my time in college I dabbled in acting and computer science.  I was introduced to computer science with the java programming
      <br/>
    language and cobol.  After learning of all the things I can do with computer science I fell in love with it.  By that time, I was almost done with my bachelors so decided
    <br/>
  to finish up. I didn't stop participating in acting after college.  I actually took some classes and participated in a commerical.  I've also done some freelance modeling just 
  <br/>
in case you come across some pictures of me.  I 've been computer programming off and on since college.  I'm a full stack developer, which means I can handle all the work 
<br/>
of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. One more thing, I do cyber security as well.  I'm actually working on my masters in Information Technology with a
<br/> 
specialization in cybersecurity.  If your not technical, cyber security is the defense of computer systems basically.  So that is a little about me. </p>
